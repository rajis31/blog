                It’s been 49 (!) days since I last updated the <a href="#">Market Values</a> Google Sheet, and a lot has
                happened in those
                48 days: personal and otherwise. (I got approached by DynastyLeagueFootball and FFStatistics for writing
                positions!

                I’m making it sound like there are (good?) excuses as to why I haven’t updated the market values since
                the
                end of December last year - but none of them are quite accurate. The real reason for the delay was that
                I
                was struggling to figure out how to incorporate the 2019 picks into the values table. This class has a
                rather unprecedentedly bad reputation, especially for this time of year, which really throws a wrench
                into
                my usual draft-pick-value methodology. Let’s take a deeper dive into this.
            </p>

        <div class="subtitle">
            <p>Usual Methodology </p>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Dynasty owners are notorious for valuing picks extremely high, despite their typically low
                conversion/hit-rate (I did a hit-rate study a while back, Jacob Rickrode’s was far more popular, both
                amounted to the same thing: drafting your actual picks is typically lower EV than you might think).
                Despite
                the analytics, we still trade picks at their topline premium. We have supreme confidence in our ability
                to
                evaluate and beat the odds. We’re in love with the allure of youth, unknown, and upside.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                We have a tendency to look at picks through rose-colored glasses: when you look at the 1.02 draft pick
                you
                mentally frame it as “the second best player in the class”, anchoring that bias into your mind. You see
                and
                weigh fewer flaws into the valuation. This heightens over the course of the draft cycle up until the
                league’s rookie draft - where the moment a pick is converted to a player all of that specific player’s
                flaws
                finally weigh back into the mental value calculation.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                My usual methodology tries to approximate this “top-line” view by aggregating what the CURRENT best in
                the
                past few draft classes are ranked in terms of value. For example, the 1.10 pick by my methodology is
                equal
                to the average of the value of the current tenth best players in the 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 draft
                classes as ranked right now. The goal of the method is (and has always been) to determine the absolute
                maximum a pick should be worth. I’m always surprised by the number of people who tell me that even this
                price can be too low - Saquon and 1.01 went for far more than the expectation last year!

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                2019 presented an interesting challenge to my usual process because of how much negative sentiment there
                is
                at the top-end of the prospect list. It was instantly clear to me that in no way would 1.01 be valued in
                the
                top 5 overall dynasty picks (thank you, Saquon! :smirk:) as originally planned. Was there any validity
                for
                these pick values? Only one way to find out: testing! 🤓

                Despite being a data nerd, I didn’t take a very scientifically rigorous approach to this. I picked
                several
                pairings from the generated pick values and put them up on Reddit, Twitter, and a few league chats,
                asking
                for people to describe how close the comparisons were.

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>I got a sample of responses back - but here were two overriding results:</p>
            <div class="list">
                <ul>
                    <li class="item">
                        <p>1. 1.04 was worth far less than the guys valued around the pick (Thielen and Michel) - most
                            people said that they’d slot the 1.01 right around that spot at this time.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="item">
                        <p> 2. It quickly returns back to being about equal at 1.07 - and from that point on there was
                            the
                            usual
                            wide disparity of dynasty owner opinions</p>

                What to do? In theory, I could manually adjust the ranks so that 1.01-1.05 are slotted in at a certain
                position…but I’ve never meant for these values to be a display of personal rankings and that would
                definitely compromise that goal.

                I continued tweaking and testing the algorithm, trying to weight the different classes and factors to
                see if
                the picks would better fit - but the answer never materialized.

            <p>Ending decision: just publish it anyway!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>So now that I’m nearing fifty days without an update, I’ve decided on my final algorithm - straight-line
                averaging across the 2015-16-17-18 classes. Once actual 2019 rankings come out, I’ll weight them into
                the
                value of the picks (and by more than the usual gradual easing-in).</p>

                I’ve defended trade calculators in many an argument, and at the end of the day my answer has always been
                the
                same - it’s an approximation of what is considered fair value, but shouldn’t be used as the be-all
                end-all
                for trade decisions. I also post things openly so that you can tweak them to your liking - if you think
                1.01
                is worth where 1.05 is worth, feel free to reference 1.05 wherever you would normally have referenced
                1.01.
                It’s a tool that you can adjust however you see fit!
