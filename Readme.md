# Intro # 

  This is my blog site template which I use to post articles about something interesting related to the technology stack that I use. A simple `Flask` file is used to serve this site while the frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I created this site as a way to share my postings to others and as a vertical for other developers/analysts to use. The articles themselves do feature a comments sections and the comments are stored in a MySQL table. 
  
 # Future Plans # 
 
  A content management side is being developed that will allow articles to be posted much easier, a search feature functionality is being implemented that will articles to be searched much quicker based on various keywords, and some additional formatting with the frontend is being worked on to allow for trending articles to appear first.
